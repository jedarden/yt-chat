# LS4 Test Specifications

## 1. Browse and Summary Components

### Browse Component

#### Test Case 1: Renders List of Items
- **Intent:** Verify that the browse component renders a provided list of items.
- **Arrange:** Provide a mock list of 5 items.
- **Act:** Render the component.
- **Assert:** All 5 items are visible in the DOM.

#### Test Case 2: Handles Empty State Gracefully
- **Intent:** Ensure the component displays an appropriate message when the item list is empty.
- **Arrange:** Provide an empty list.
- **Act:** Render the component.
- **Assert:** "No items found" message is displayed.

#### Test Case 3: Item Selection Updates State
- **Intent:** Confirm that selecting an item triggers the correct state update.
- **Arrange:** Provide a list of items and a mock selection handler.
- **Act:** Simulate user clicking on the second item.
- **Assert:** Selection handler is called with the correct item data.

#### Test Case 4: Error Handling on Data Fetch Failure
- **Intent:** Validate error message is shown if data fetch fails.
- **Arrange:** Mock data fetch to reject with an error.
- **Act:** Render the component.
- **Assert:** Error message is displayed.

### Summary Component

#### Test Case 1: Displays Summary for Selected Item
- **Intent:** Ensure the summary component displays details for a selected item.
- **Arrange:** Provide a mock item with summary details.
- **Act:** Render the component with the item as prop.
- **Assert:** All summary fields are rendered correctly.

#### Test Case 2: Handles Null or Missing Item
- **Intent:** Confirm the component handles null or missing item gracefully.
- **Arrange:** Pass `null` or `undefined` as the item prop.
- **Act:** Render the component.
- **Assert:** "No item selected" message is displayed.

#### Test Case 3: Updates on Prop Change
- **Intent:** Ensure the summary updates when a new item is selected.
- **Arrange:** Render with item A, then update prop to item B.
- **Act:** Trigger prop change.
- **Assert:** Summary updates to reflect item B.

#### Test Case 4: Handles Malformed Item Data
- **Intent:** Validate component behavior when item data is missing fields.
- **Arrange:** Provide an item with missing/undefined fields.
- **Act:** Render the component.
- **Assert:** Component does not crash; missing fields are handled (e.g., shown as "N/A").

## 2. Security Simulation Tests

### XSS Attack Simulation

#### Procedure:
1. **Setup:** Render a component that displays user input.
2. **Execution:** Inject a script tag as user input (`<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
3. **Verification:** Assert that the script is not executed and is rendered as plain text or sanitized.

#### Expected Outcome:
- Script is not executed; no alert appears.
- Input is sanitized or escaped.

### CSRF Attack Simulation

#### Procedure:
1. **Setup:** Mock a sensitive state-changing endpoint (e.g., POST /api/update).
2. **Execution:** Simulate a cross-origin POST request without CSRF token.
3. **Verification:** Assert that the request is rejected (e.g., 403 Forbidden).

#### Expected Outcome:
- Request is blocked or rejected due to missing/invalid CSRF token.

### Injection Attack Simulation

#### Procedure:
1. **Setup:** Mock a backend endpoint that processes user input.
2. **Execution:** Submit input containing SQL/command injection payload (`'; DROP TABLE users;--`).
3. **Verification:** Assert that the payload is not executed and input is handled safely.

#### Expected Outcome:
- No backend error or data loss; input is sanitized or rejected.

### New Vulnerability Scenario: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

#### Procedure:
1. **Setup:** Authenticate as user A; obtain resource ID belonging to user B.
2. **Execution:** Attempt to access user B's resource using their ID.
3. **Verification:** Assert that access is denied (e.g., 403 Forbidden or resource not found).

#### Expected Outcome:
- Access to unauthorized resources is blocked.

### Updating and Extending Simulations

- Document each new threat scenario with setup, execution, and verification steps.
- Add new test cases as vulnerabilities are discovered.
- Ensure all simulations are automated and reproducible in the test suite.

## 3. CI Workflow Security Enforcement Tests

### Step 1: Updating Security Checks

- **Test:** When a new security check is added to the codebase, the CI pipeline detects and enforces it.
- **Procedure:** Add a new linting rule or static analysis check; trigger CI.
- **Expected:** CI fails if the rule is violated; passes when compliant.

### Step 2: Automating Vulnerability Scans

- **Test:** CI pipeline runs automated vulnerability scans on dependencies and code.
- **Procedure:** Introduce a known vulnerable dependency; trigger CI.
- **Expected:** CI fails and reports the vulnerability.

### Step 3: Documenting Enforcement for New Threats

- **Test:** When a new vulnerability scenario is added, documentation is updated and CI enforces checks.
- **Procedure:** Add a new threat scenario to the documentation and a corresponding test/check to CI.
- **Expected:** CI verifies the presence of documentation and enforcement steps.

### Step 4: Integration of New Vulnerabilities

- **Test:** CI process is updated to include new vulnerability scenarios.
- **Procedure:** Add a new simulation script or test; update CI config.
- **Expected:** CI runs the new simulation/test and reports results.

### Templates/Examples

- **Documentation Template:**  
  - Threat Name  
  - Description  
  - Simulation Steps  
  - Expected Outcome  
  - Enforcement Steps  
  - Date Added  
  - Reviewer

- **CI Enforcement Example:**  
  - Step: `run: npm audit --audit-level=high`  
  - Step: `run: npm run test:security`  
  - Step: `run: ./scripts/check-threat-docs.sh`

## Maintenance and Auditability

- All procedures must be version-controlled.
- Each enforcement/test step must be documented with date and reviewer.
- Regularly review and update test cases and CI scripts as new threats emerge.
