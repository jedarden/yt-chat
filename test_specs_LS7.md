# Test Specifications for LS7

---

## 1. Test-to-Requirement Mapping Update

### 1.1 Mapping Table Completeness
- **Arrange:** Review all new and changed tests from LS6 and LS7 (e.g., XSS edge cases, CI enforcement, backend error handling).
- **Act:** Update the test-to-requirement mapping table in [`TEST_COVERAGE.md`](TEST_COVERAGE.md) to include these tests.
- **Assert:**
  - All relevant tests are referenced in the mapping table.
  - Each entry includes the test file/name, spec section(s), requirement/user story, and clear notes.
  - Table formatting is preserved.

### 1.2 Traceability Verification
- **Arrange:** Cross-reference requirements and user stories with the mapping table.
- **Act:** Audit the table for missing or outdated entries.
- **Assert:**
  - There is complete traceability between tests and requirements.
  - No new or changed test is omitted.

## 2. Rationale Comment Deduplication in Frontend Components

### 2.1 Single Rationale Block per File
- **Arrange:** Inspect [`frontend/src/components/Browse.js`](frontend/src/components/Browse.js) and [`frontend/src/components/Summary.js`](frontend/src/components/Summary.js) for output escaping rationale comments.
- **Act:** Refactor to ensure only one detailed rationale block comment exists at the top of each file.
- **Assert:**
  - No redundant rationale comments are present.
  - A single, comprehensive block comment explains the output escaping rationale at the top of each file.

### 2.2 Concise Inline Comments
- **Arrange:** Review inline comments related to output escaping in the same files.
- **Act:** Replace any lengthy or redundant inline rationale with brief, targeted comments only where necessary.
- **Assert:**
  - Inline comments are concise and only present where contextually needed.
  - No file contains more than one detailed rationale block.

## 3. Automated Double-Escaping Detection in Frontend

### 3.1 Double-Escaping Test
- **Arrange:** Prepare test inputs that would reveal double-escaping if both `escapeHtml` and React escaping are applied (e.g., `<script>`).
- **Act:** Render these inputs in all relevant components (Browse, Summary) using the current escaping logic.
- **Assert:**
  - The rendered output contains exactly one level of escaping (e.g., `<script>` becomes `<script>`).
  - The output does not show double-escaped entities (e.g., `&lt;script&gt;`).
  - The test fails if double-escaping is detected.

### 3.2 Coverage and Rationale Documentation
- **Requirement:** The test must include comments explaining the rationale for detecting double-escaping and its security implications.

---

## 4. CI Fallback Pattern Enforcement

### 4.1 Comprehensive Fallback Pattern Test
- **Arrange:** Prepare CI scripts containing various fallback patterns: `|| echo`, `|| true`, `|| :`, `|| printf`.
- **Act:** Run the CI enforcement test in [`ci_enforcement.test.js`](ci_enforcement.test.js) with these patterns present.
- **Assert:**
  - The test fails if any of these fallback patterns are detected in CI scripts.
  - The regex used in the test matches all specified patterns.

### 4.2 Rationale Documentation
- **Requirement:** The test must include comments explaining why these fallback patterns are disallowed and the security risks they pose.

---

## 5. Backend Error Handling Documentation

### 5.1 Coverage Note for Error Handling Logic
- **Arrange:** Review [`TEST_COVERAGE.md`](TEST_COVERAGE.md) for backend error handling documentation.
- **Act:** Add a note explaining how the backend's deterministic/randomized status code logic is tested in test and production environments.
- **Assert:**
  - The note clearly describes the test approach for error handling.
  - The rationale for using deterministic logic in tests and randomized logic in production is explained.
  - The note is placed in the appropriate section of the coverage document.

---

## 6. General Documentation and Traceability

### 6.1 Rationale and Coverage Comments
- **Requirement:** All new and updated test and implementation files must include comments explaining security decisions, especially for escaping, error handling, and CI enforcement.

### 6.2 Self-Documenting Variables
- **Requirement:** Use clear, descriptive variable names in all new and updated code and tests.

### 6.3 Coverage Summaries
- **Requirement:** Each test file must include a section or comment block summarizing coverage, rationale for test scenarios, and any known limitations.

---

## Test Coverage Notes

- All tests must be written before implementation (TDD).
- Each test must be self-contained and independent.
- Document any reliance on framework-level protections (e.g., React escaping).
- Maintain parity between test specs and actual test files.
- Update documentation and comments as requirements evolve.
