  "rationale": {
    "complexity": "Specs are modular and well-structured, but lack explicit test case examples and automation details, increasing cognitive load.",
    "coverage": "Coverage goals are ambitious and broad, but lack specifics on measurement and handling of hard-to-cover code. Most critical paths are addressed.",
    "performance": "Performance is considered (e.g., large transcripts, CI parallelization), but test automation and optimization strategies are only partially specified.",
    "clarity": "Specs are logically organized, but ambiguity remains due to missing concrete examples, traceability, and documentation format.",
    "security": "Security is prioritized with input validation, secret handling, and attack simulation, but lacks detailed negative test scenarios and regular update processes."
