## Prompt LS4_1

### Context
Previous test specifications and outputs have not provided explicit, concrete test cases for the browse and summary components. This gap has led to incomplete coverage and ambiguity in expected behaviors, as highlighted in LS3 scores and annotations.

### Task
Expand the test suite by adding diverse, explicit test cases for both the browse and summary components in the frontend. Cover rendering, user interaction, edge cases, and integration with state management.

### Requirements
- For each component (browse, summary), provide at least three distinct test cases.
- Include tests for normal operation, edge cases, and error handling.
- Specify sample inputs, user actions, and expected outputs for each test.
- Use descriptive test names and document the intent of each case.
- Ensure tests are compatible with the current frontend testing framework.

### Previous Issues
- Lack of explicit test examples for browse and summary components.
- Ambiguity in expected behaviors and insufficient edge case coverage.

### Expected Output
A set of well-documented test cases for browse and summary components, formatted for direct inclusion in the frontend test suite.

## Prompt LS4_2

### Context
Security simulation instructions in prior layers have been too general, lacking step-by-step detail for attack simulations and not specifying expected outcomes or new vulnerability scenarios. LS3 annotations highlight the need for more granular, actionable security tests.

### Task
Enhance security simulation detail by specifying step-by-step procedures for simulating attacks (e.g., XSS, CSRF, injection), defining expected outcomes, and introducing new vulnerability scenarios relevant to the application.

### Requirements
- For each attack type, outline a detailed simulation procedure (setup, execution, verification).
- Specify the expected result for each simulation (e.g., attack blocked, error message shown).
- Introduce at least one new vulnerability scenario not previously covered.
- Document how to update and extend simulations as new threats emerge.
- Ensure all procedures are reproducible and suitable for automation.

### Previous Issues
- Security simulations lacked actionable, stepwise instructions.
- No clear mapping between simulated attacks and expected outcomes.
- Insufficient coverage of emerging vulnerability scenarios.

### Expected Output
A set of detailed, step-by-step security simulation procedures, each with clear expected outcomes and guidance for future updates.

## Prompt LS4_3

### Context
Continuous Integration (CI) enforcement for security and vulnerability management has lacked specificity, particularly regarding updating security checks, automating vulnerability scans, and documenting enforcement steps for new threats. LS3 feedback calls for more precise, actionable CI procedures.

### Task
Increase CI enforcement specificity by detailing procedures for updating security checks, automating vulnerability scans, and documenting enforcement steps for new and emerging threats.

### Requirements
- Define CI pipeline steps for updating and enforcing security checks.
- Specify tools and scripts for automated vulnerability scanning.
- Document the process for integrating new vulnerability scenarios into CI.
- Provide templates or examples for documenting enforcement actions and outcomes.
- Ensure procedures are maintainable and auditable.

### Previous Issues
- CI enforcement steps for security were too general and lacked actionable detail.
- No clear process for integrating new vulnerabilities or documenting enforcement.

### Expected Output
A comprehensive, step-by-step guide for CI security enforcement, including pipeline steps, automation scripts, and documentation templates.
